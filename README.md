    > Check out the previous example for FULL OUTER JOIN emulation in MySQL.
    >
    > JOIN combines both tables based on common column(s) (in our last video that column was the EmployeeID which we had in both tables), while UNION combines both tables based on common rows.
    >
    > My comments:
    >
    > - JOIN combines both tables horizontally, while UNION combines both tables vertically. In other words, JOIN puts both tables side by side, while UNION puts both tables on top of each other (below each other).
    > - Also, UNION removes the duplicates, while UNION ALL keeps the duplicates.

    > My comment (about UNION and UNION ALL):
    >
    > ```
    > SELECT *
    > FROM EmployeeDemographics
    > UNION
    > SELECT *
    > FROM EmployeeSalary;
    >
    > SELECT *
    > FROM EmployeeDemographics
    > UNION ALL
    > SELECT *
    > FROM EmployeeSalary;
    > ```
    >
    > The first query will return 5 rows, while the second query will return 6 rows (because there is one duplicate row in the EmployeeSalary table).

    > My comment (about the example in the previous video, about FULL JOIN done using UNION):
    >
    > Even though it looks as though the results is horizontal, it's actually vertical. How?
    > The first query returns 5 rows, while the second query returns 4 rows.
    > So the result of the UNION is 9 rows (4 rows are placed **below** first 5 rows and then), which is the same as the result of the FULL JOIN.

    > My comment (about selecting columns in UNION):
    >
    > ```
    > SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, Age
    > FROM EmployeeDemographics
    > UNION
    > SELECT EmployeeID, JobTitle, Salary
    > FROM EmployeeSalary
    > ```
    >
    > If we select columns like this, we will not get the desired result. Why? Because the columns in the first query are different than the columns in the second query. So we need to select the same number of columns in both queries, and the columns need to be of the same type (or at least compatible types).

  - [x] 9. Intermediate SQL Tutorial | Case Statement | Use Cases (185K views, 3 years ago, 7:26)

    > Case statement allows us to specify a condition and then also specify what we want returned (a result) if that condition is met.
    > (Case statement allows us to create a new column based on the values of other columns.)
    >
    > We can put multiple WHEN statements in the CASE statement.
    > Example:
    >
    > ```
    > SELECT FirstName, LastName, Age,
    > CASE
    > WHEN Age < 18 THEN 'Minor'
    > WHEN Age >= 18 AND Age <= 65 THEN 'Adult'
    > ELSE 'Senior'
    > END AS 'AgeGroup'
    > FROM EmployeeDemographics;
    > ```
    >
    > Something to note is that the CASE statement is evaluated in order. So if the first WHEN statement is true, then it will return that result and not check the other WHEN statements.

    > My comment:
    >
    > So if we have multiple WHEN statements, we need to make sure that the most specific WHEN statement is first, and the most general WHEN statement is last.
    > Example:
    >
    > ```
    > SELECT FirstName, LastName, Age,
    > CASE
    > 	WHEN Age > 30 THEN 'Old'
    > 	WHEN Age = 38 THEN 'Stanley' # Previous WHEN statement is true, so this one is not checked. So this one is never true.
    > 	ELSE 'Baby'                  # Solution: change the order of WHEN statements.
    > END
    > FROM EmployeeDemographics
    > WHERE Age is NOT NULL
    > ORDER BY Age
    > ```

    > Another example (about using CASE statement with JOIN):
    >
    > ```
    > SELECT *,
    > CASE
    > 	WHEN JobTitle = 'Salesman' THEN Salary + (Salary * .10)
    > 	WHEN JobTitle = 'Accountant' THEN Salary + (Salary * .05)
    > 	WHEN JobTitle = 'HR' THEN Salary + (Salary * .000001)
    > END AS 'Salary after raise'
    > FROM EmployeeDemographics ed
    > JOIN EmployeeSalary es
    > ON ed.EmployeeID = es.EmployeeID
    > ```

  - [x] 10. Intermediate SQL Tutorial | Having Clause (102K views, 3 years ago, 3:31)

    > The HAVING clause is used to filter the results of an aggregate function.
    > Example:
    >
    > ```
    > SELECT JobTitle, COUNT(JobTitle)
    > FROM EmployeeDemographics ed
    > JOIN EmployeeSalary es
    > ON ed.EmployeeID = es.EmployeeID
    > GROUP BY JobTitle
    > HAVING COUNT(JobTitle) > 1 # This cannot be placed above GROUP BY.
    >                            # It has to be placed below GROUP BY because it's an aggregate function.
    > ```

    > The SQL query components need to be in a specific order due to the way SQL engines parse and execute queries. The SQL standard defines a particular sequence in which the clauses should appear in a SELECT statement. Here is the typical order:

    > Why does HAVING clause have to go below GROUP BY clause?

    > 2. FROM: Specifies the tables from which to select or delete or the tables to update.
    > 3. JOIN: Combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.
    > 4. WHERE: Filters records before any groupings are made.
    > 5. GROUP BY: Groups records after the WHERE clause has been applied. The grouping is done on the basis of columns. Aggregate functions (like COUNT, AVG, MAX, etc.) then operate on these groups.
    > 6. HAVING: Filters records after the GROUP BY clause has been applied.
    > 7. ORDER BY: Sorts the records, but does this last, after all filtering and grouping have been done.
    > ```

    > My comment (a quick recap) of the difference between WHERE and HAVING:
    >
    > - WHERE filters records before any groupings are made.
    > - HAVING filters records after the GROUP BY clause has been applied.

    > My comment about aggregate functions vs. GROUP BY:
    >
    > - Aggregate functions (e.g., COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX): Perform calculations on a set of values and return a single value.
    > - GROUP BY clause: Groups rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows.

  - [x] 11. Intermediate SQL Tutorial | Updating/Deleting Data (86K views, 3 years ago, 4:37)

    > The difference between INSERT and UPDATE is that INSERT adds a new row to a table, while UPDATE modifies existing rows in a table.

    > Example:
    >
    > ```
    > UPDATE EmployeeDemographics
    > SET Age = 31, Gender = 'Female'
    > WHERE EmployeeID = 1012
    > ```

    > **Good practice**, before DELETE, is to use SELECT to see what we are going to delete.
    >
    > ```
    > SELECT * FROM EmployeeDemographics
    > WHERE EmployeeID  = 1005
    > ```

    > DELETE statement is used to delete rows from a table.
    > Example:
    >
    > ```
    > DELETE FROM EmployeeDemographics
    > WHERE EmployeeID  = 1005
    > ```

  - [x] 12. Intermediate SQL Tutorial | Aliasing (85K views, 3 years ago, 6:12)

    ````
    Useful hint for writing SQL statements:
    When writing the SQL statement, first write the FROM clause with an alias. Then, when writing the SELECT statement, use the alias to refer to the table - which will give us a dropdown list of all the columns in that table.```
    ````

    > Now, continuing with the lecture...

    > Aliasing is used to give a table, or a column in a table, a temporary name.

    > My example:
    >
    > ```
    > SELECT ed.EmployeeID, ed.FirstName, ed.LastName, es.Salary
    > FROM EmployeeDemographics ed
    > JOIN EmployeeSalary es
    > ON ed.EmployeeID = es.EmployeeID
    > ```

    > Another example:
    >
    > ```
    > SELECT FirstName AS fn
    > FROM EmployeeDemographics AS ed
    > ```
    >
    > is the same as:
    >
    > ```
    > SELECT FirstName fn
    > FROM EmployeeDemographics
    > ```

    > Another example:
    >
    > ```
    > SELECT CONCAT(FirstName, ' ', LastName) AS 'Full Name'
    > FROM EmployeeDemographics
    > ```

    > Another time we'll use aliasing in the SELECT statement is when we want to use an aggregate function.
    > Example:
    >
    > ```
    > SELECT AVG(Age) AS 'Average Age'
    > FROM EmployeeDemographics
    > ```

    > Untill now, we used aliasing for **column** names. But we can also use aliasing for **table** names.
    > Example:
    >
    > ```
    > SELECT Demographics.EmployeeID
    > FROM EmployeeDemographics Demographics
    > ```

  - [x] 13. Intermediate SQL Tutorial | Partition By (163K views, 2 years ago, 4:14)

    > PARTITION BY statement is often compared to GROUP BY statement. But they are not the same. The GROUP BY statement is going to reduce the number of rows in our result set by actually "rolling them up" (by calculating the sum, or averages for each group), while the PARTITION BY statement is going to divide the result set into partitions (and change how the window function is calculated) without reducing the number of rows in our result set.

    > SELECT ed.FirstName, ed.LastName, ed.Gender, es.Salary, COUNT(Gender)
    > OVER (PARTITION BY Gender) as TotalGender
    > FROM EmployeeDemographics ed
    > JOIN EmployeeSalary es
    > ON ed.EmployeeID = es.EmployeeID

    > What is a "window function"?
    > A window function is a function that can be applied to a partition of rows. It is also called an "analytic function".
    > Another way to think about it is that a window function is a function that can be applied to a group of rows that are related to the current row.
    >
    > ChatGPT's answer:
    >
    > ```
    > A window function in SQL allows you to perform calculations across a set of table rows that are related to the current row, almost like a sliding "window" over the data. This is analogous to the way a window in a GUI application displays a subportion of the overall data. What makes window functions unique is that they provide access to more than just the current row of the query result.
    >
    > Unlike aggregate functions, which return a single result value based on a group of rows, window functions return a single value for each row from the underlying query result based on a window of rows related to that row.
    >
    > Key components of window functions:
    >
    > 1. OVER() Clause: This defines the window of rows for the function to operate on. You can specify ordering and partitioning within this clause.
    > 2. PARTITION BY: This divides the result set into partitions to which the window function is applied. For instance, if you want to operate on groups of rows having the same value in a certain column (e.g., date or category), you'd use PARTITION BY.
    > 3. ORDER BY: Within the OVER() clause, this determines the order in which rows will be processed by the window function.
    > 4. ROWS/RANGE: Specifies which rows are included in the frame. The frame is a subset of the current partition and is used for calculation in functions like running totals.
    >
    > Examples of window functions:
    >
    > - Ranking functions: ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), NTILE().
    > - Analytic functions: LEAD(), LAG(), FIRST_VALUE(), LAST_VALUE().
    > - Aggregate functions: SUM(), AVG(), MIN(), MAX(). These can be used as window functions when combined with the OVER() clause.
    >
    > Using our earlier example, COUNT(Gender) OVER (PARTITION BY Gender) is a window function. For each row in the dataset, it counts the number of rows with the same Gender value.
    >
    > In essence, window functions let you perform calculations that require considering a range or "window" of rows relative to the current row, without collapsing all those rows into a single output row.
    > ```

    > Aditional explanation [Colt Steele - SQL Window Functions in 10 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1KCM8vbYe4)
    >
    > Several things to note:
    >
    > - Window functions perform aggregate operations on group of rows but they **produce a result FOR EACH ROW**. So we have individual row data alongside aggregated data.
    > - The OVER() clause constructs a window. When it's empty, the window will include all records.
    > - Use ORDER BY inside of the OVER() clause to re-order rows within each window.
    > - The PARTITION BY clause divides the window into smaller sets or partitions. The window function is applied to each partition separately and computation restarts for each partition. (Copilot suggestion)

  - [x] 14. Advanced SQL Tutorial | CTE (Common Table Expression) (214K views, 2 years ago, 3:44)

    > CTE is a common table expression and it's a named temporary result set which is used to manipulate (Copilot suggestion: the data in the result set further) the complex sub-queries data. This only exists within the scope of the statement that we're about to write. Once we cancel out of this query it's like it never existed. A CTE is also only created in memory rather than a tempdb file like a temp table would be, but in general a CTE acts very much like a subquery and so if we know how to write subqueries we can easily learn how to write CTEs.

    > CTEs are sometimes called "WITH" queries because we use the WITH keyword to create them. The syntax is as follows:
    >
    > ```
    > WITH CTE_Employee as
    > (SELECT ed.FirstName, ed.LastName, ed.Gender, es.Salary,
    > COUNT(Gender) OVER (PARTITION BY Gender) as TotalGender,
    > AVG(Salary) OVER (PARTITION BY Gender) AS AvgSalary
    > FROM EmployeeDemographics ed
    > JOIN EmployeeSalary es
    > ON ed.EmployeeID = es.EmployeeID
    > WHERE Salary > '45000')
    >
    > SELECT *
    > FROM CTE_Employee
    > ```

    > Explanation suggested by the Copilot:
    > CTE is a temporary result set that we can reference within another SQL statement. It's similar to a subquery, but it's more readable and easier to maintain.
    >
    > Example:
    >
    > ```
    > WITH EmployeeCTE AS (
    > 	SELECT *
    > 	FROM EmployeeDemographics
    > 	WHERE Age > 30
    > )
    >
    > SELECT *
    > FROM EmployeeCTE
    > ```

    > Aditional explanation (check out [LearnatKnowstar - SQL | Subquery or CTE - Which one to choose? Difference between Subquery and CTE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UblBNXXojoc)):
    >
    > Excerpt:\
    > CTEs are named queries (suggested by Copilot: temporary result sets) that you can reference (multiple times if needed) within another SQL statement. They are similar to subqueries, but they are more readable and easier to maintain. They are also more flexible than subqueries. For example, you can reference a CTE multiple times in the same SELECT statement, while you can only reference a subquery once.
    > In terms of performance and in terms of how the logic is executed, they are similar to subqueries (no difference as far as I can see at the moment).

    > There are scenarios where we we can use only a CTE or only a subquery:
    >
    > - CTE can be recursive, while subquery cannot be recursive:
    >   - Recursive CTEs can reference themselves in a query. (Suggested by Copilot: This is useful for querying hierarchical data (like a tree structure) or data that has a parent-child relationship.)
    > - Corelated subqueries can reference outer table from the subquery, while CTE cannot reference outer table from the CTE.
    >
    > Suggested by Copilot: there are also scenarios where we can use both. In those cases, we should use a CTE because it's more readable and easier to maintain.

    > Suggested by Copilot: Temp tables are like regular tables, but they are only available to the current session. They are also stored in tempdb, which is a system database. Temp tables are automatically deleted when the session that created them is closed.

    > We can hit off of this temp table multiple times which we cannot do with something like CTE or subquery, where we can only use it one time or with the subquery where we need to write it multiple times within the query. (TODO: check this)\
    > Example:
    >
    > ```
    > CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE temp_Employee (
    > EmployeeID int,
    > JobTitle varchar(100),
    > Salary int
    > )
    >
    > SELECT *
    > FROM temp_Employee
    > ```

    > Maybe the best way to work with temp tables is to take a subset of data from a (much) larger table, put it into a temp table, and then work with that temp table.\
    > Example:
    >
    > ```
    > INSERT INTO temp_Employee
    > SELECT *
    > FROM EmployeeSalary AS es
    > WHERE es.Salary > '40000'
    > ```

    > Realistic example:
    > We have a table with 100 million rows. We want to do some analysis on that table, but we don't want to do it on the entire table. So we can create a temp table with a subset of data from that table, and then do the analysis on that temp table. (Suggested by Copilot)
    >
    > ```
    > CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE temp_Employee2
    > SELECT JobTitle, Count(JobTitle), Avg(Age), Avg(Salary)
    > FROM EmployeeDemographics AS ed
    > JOIN EmployeeSalary AS es
    > ON ed.EmployeeID = es.EmployeeID
    > GROUP BY JobTitle
    > ```

    > Useful for later: A lot of times these temp tables are used in **stored procedures**.
    > (we'll need to remove the temp table before we can create it again)\
    > Example:
    >
    > ```
    > DROP TABLE IF EXISTS temp_Employee
    > CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE temp_Employee (
    > ...
    > )
    >
    > INSERT INTO temp_Employee
    > SELECT *
    > FROM ...
    >
    > SELECT *
    > FROM temp_Employee
    > ```

    - [ ] Go through the course [Python - Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw)
    - [ ] Go through the book ["Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) by Al Sweigart
      - [ ] If you don't want to read the book, you can watch the [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python Programming Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1F_OgqRuSdI)
        - If you still feel your Python coding skills are weak go through the first 8 chapters of the book
        - If you feel comfortable with Python coding, skip the first 8 chapters and go through the rest of the book
        - That's all you need to know about Python. If you need something else, learn it on the fly by just Googling it!
  - Step 2: Get a high-level understanding of what Machine Learning is (NOTE: Aleksa mentioned that he took 2.5 months, while working, to go through these 2 courses)
    -  [ ] Course 1: [Machine Learning by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)
    - [ ] Course 2: [Deep Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)
    - Start working on projects and put them on GitHub + write a blog!
      - [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
  - Step 3 (more practical):
    - [ ] Course 1: [Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and PyTorch](https://course.fast.ai/)
    - [ ] Course 2: [Deep Learning from the Foundations](https://course.fast.ai/part2)
    - Start focusing on one Deep Learning Framework; Aleksa recommends PyTorch \
      NOTE: The previous 3 steps can take up to 6 months if we're a beginner
  - Step 4: Start reading research papers and implement a single paper
    - List of places to find research papers (NOTE: Everything but the first link was added by the Copilot):
      - [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/) - a good place to start
      - [OpenAI](https://openai.com/)
      - [DeepMind](https://deepmind.com/)
      - [Google AI](https://ai.google/)
      - [Facebook AI](https://ai.facebook.com/)
      - [Twitter AI](https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/topics/insights.html)
      - [LinkedIn AI](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog)
      - [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/)
      - [Apple AI](https://machinelearning.apple.com/)
      - [Amazon AI](https://www.amazon.science/)
      - [Baidu AI](https://ai.baidu.com/)
      - [Alibaba AI](https://damo.alibaba.com/)
      - [Tencent AI](https://ai.tencent.com/)
      - [Huawei AI](https://www.huawei.com/en/industry-insights/ai)
      - [NVIDIA AI](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai/)
      - [Intel AI](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/artificial-intelligence/overview.html)
      - [IBM Research](https://www.research.ibm.com/artificial-intelligence/)
      - [MIT AI](https://www.csail.mit.edu/)
      - [Stanford AI](https://ai.stanford.edu/)
      - [Berkeley AI](https://bair.berkeley.edu/)
      - [CMU AI](https://www.cmu.edu/scs/ai/)
      - [Oxford AI](https://www.oxford.cs.ox.ac.uk/)\
        NOTE: We're going to feel so dumb (I'm sure I will). Read the paper from start to end. It's OK if we don't understand everything on the first pass while reading the paper. Aleksa read about 20ish papers in Neural style transfer. We should read at least a couple of papers on a particular subject and then implement the paper.
  - Step 5: Mathematics
    - Resources:
      - [Mathematics for Machine Learning by Marc Peter Deisenroth, A. Aldo Faisal, Cheng Soon Ong](https://mml-book.github.io/) (NOTE: It took Aleksa about 3-4 months to go through this book but he supplemented it with the resources below)
      - [3Blue1Brown (playlist) - Essence of Linear Algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab)
      - [3Blue1Brown (playlist) - Essence of Calculus](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr)
      - [Jake VanderPlas - Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/)
        - We should go through the 5th chapter of the book - it's about Machine Learning
      - [Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, Aaron Courville - Deep Learning](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/), and https://github.com/janishar/mit-deep-learning-book-pdf \
        NOTE: Maybe check the new book by Simon Prince called "Understanding Deep Learning". Check out this video [Machine Learning Street Talk - Deep Learning is a strange beast.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJXn4Cl4oww)
  - BONUS TIPS:
    - [Coursera - Barbara Oakley - Learning how to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn)
    - Don't learn tools for the sake of tooling. Learn them when you need them.
      - Aleksa doesn't even use Pandas because he doesn't work with structured data but with imagery because he works in computer vision. He uses PyTorch and NumPy (this short sentence is added by the Copilot)
    - Build your own stuff after going through the theory. Set the project goal - that's the "What" and a lot of "Hows" will follow up. If you need for example Pandas, to acomplish the project - learn it on the fly.
    - FOCUS, FOCUS, FOCUS. In the beginning, focus on the single deep learning framework (use PyTorch). Focus on the single application area (computer vision, NLP or something else).

### Machine learning projects

  - Reimplementing a paper and recreating it's results
    - Step 1: Read the paper
      - Methodology: Use colored markers to highlight the important parts
        - Color no. 1 (General understanding): We want to highlight the parts that are important for understanding the paper
        - Color no. 2 (Implementation details): Actively highlight the parts relevant for the implementation.\
          This includes things like used loss loss functions, used activation functions, used architectures, used datasets, used hyperparameters etc. When highlighting these parts, we can already start envisioning how we would start to implement the architecture and which other repositories we alredy know that have similar implementations that we can use for our own new implementation. Or we write down a list of common modules we need to look up existing implementations for. The idea is not to not to reinvent the wheel, but to use existing implementations and to understand how they work and how they can be adapted to our own needs.
        - Color no. 3 (Datasets): Since we are not only reimplement the paper but also recreate results to actually verify whether we implemented the paper successfully, we need to train on the same datasets and evaluate on the same ones. Highlighting those should not too difficult, since the paper should already mention the datasets used and the evaluation metrics used.\
          It might also be important to look for details about the compute that the authors used. If they used expensive compute, we might need to look for alternatives or we might need to look for ways to reduce the compute needed. This might be important for us, since we might not have access to the same compute as the authors of the paper. \
          Tackle the datasets. That means - find the datasets used in the paper and download them.
    - Step 2: Implementing the dataset and data loader classes (PyTorch).\
      Data loader is used to provide data in a preprocessed format. That way we can very consistently get a batch of data and just focus on the training logic. When implementing the dataset and data loader classes he recomments to use Jupyter Notebooks. That makes it very easy to save certain variables (like the path to the dataset) and visualize everything we need.\
      One final thing is if we are working on a reinforcement learning paper, the equivalent to implementing the dataset classes is setting up the gym environment.
    - Step 3: Start coding\
      (NOTE: Perhaps our paper focuses more on a new training technique rather a new architecture).\
      Since we've highlighted the novel elements of the architecture and found existing implementations of modules we might need, his recommendation is to just **start coding(!!!)**. _Don't think too much about making it right the first time_. Start writing our torch.nn.module class and initialize all layers we might need. If they are larger, more complex models, we can directly start writing a function for those. [TODO: Check the mentioned example].
      - Use "Weights and Biases" to track our experiments. It's a tool that allows us to track our experiments and visualize them. It's a very powerful tool and it's free to use. (added by the Copilot)

## Mathematics courses

- [ ] [Khan Academy - Statistics and Probability](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability)
  - [ ] Unit 1: Analyzing categorical data
    - [x] Lesson 1: Analyzing one categorical variable
      - Median - is the middle value in a set of data. Example, 100 is median in this array of data: 75, 80, **100** (this is median), 100, 100.
      - Midrange - is the mean of the highest and lowest values in a set of data.
        - Example: for the array of data 75, 80, 100, 100, 100 the midrange is (75+100)/2=87.5
      - Mean - is the average value in a set of data. Example, 100 is mean in this array of data
      - Average - is the average value in a set of data.
        - NOTE: If someone says "average" without giving more information they're probably thinking about the arithmetic mean.
        - Example: for the array of data 75, 80, 100, 100, 100 the average is (75+80+100+100+100)/5=91
      - Mode - is the most commommon score. In 75, 80, 100, 100, 100, the mode is 100 because it appears 3 times.
      - Range - is the difference between the highest and lowest values in a set of data. Example: for the array of data 75, 80, 100, 100, 100 the range is 100-75=25
    - Dot plots - are used to show individual data points (bad if we have a lot of data).
    - Bar graphs - are used to show groups of data (good if we have a lot of data).
    - Histograms - displays ranges of data (good if we have a lot of data). Example: 0-10, 11-20, 21-30, etc.
